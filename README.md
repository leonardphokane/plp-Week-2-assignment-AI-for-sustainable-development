## AI Solution: "AgriSmart – AI for Sustainable Agriculture"
UN SDG Addressed: Zero Hunger (SDG 2) & Climate Action (SDG 13) AI Concepts Used: Supervised Learning, Neural Networks, NLP, Reinforcement Learning
## Problem Statement
Food insecurity and climate change threaten global agriculture. Many farmers lack access to real-time insights on soil health, weather predictions, and pest control, leading to lower crop yields. AgriSmart is an AI-powered system that helps farmers optimize food production while minimizing environmental impact.
## Core Features of AgriSmart
✅ AI-Powered Crop Recommendation (Supervised Learning)
•	Uses satellite images and historical climate data to recommend the best crops for a region.
•	Trained on labeled datasets of soil types, crop yields, and rainfall patterns.
✅ Predictive Weather Analytics (Neural Networks)
•	Analyzes meteorological data to predict rainfall, drought risks, and temperature variations.
•	Helps farmers plan irrigation and harvesting schedules.
✅ Automated Pest Detection (Computer Vision & NLP)
•	Uses image recognition to detect diseases in plants.
•	Farmers upload images of crops, and the system provides treatment recommendations using a knowledge base trained on agricultural texts (NLP).
✅ Smart Irrigation & Resource Optimization (Reinforcement Learning)
•	AI learns the optimal irrigation schedules by adjusting water use based on soil moisture levels and weather predictions.
•	Balances crop growth with minimal water wastage, reducing the ecological footprint.
Implementation Plan
🚀 Data Collection:
•	Satellite imagery, weather patterns, and open-source agricultural datasets.
